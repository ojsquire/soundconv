soundconv
=========

Sound conversion scripts. In this repo are various scripts written to convert sound files from different types
(e.g. uncompressed (wav) to compressed lossless (flac) or to compressed lossy (ogg)). They also handle adding/editing
of metadata. Eventually would be good to be able to run the whole lot from a single command with options specifying file
type and what you want to do (e.g. convert a wav2flac and add metadata, or edit flac metadata etc).
